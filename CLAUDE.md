### LangGraph Documentation

When working with LangGraph code or answering questions about LangGraph, always use the MCP server for documentation lookup:

```
Use mcp__docs-langchain__SearchDocsByLangChain tool to search for:
- LangGraph API references
- LangGraph guides and tutorials
- LangGraph examples and patterns
- LangChain integration details
```

This ensures you have access to the most accurate and up-to-date LangGraph documentation.
